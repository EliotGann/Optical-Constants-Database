# Optical-Constants-Database
Optical Constants database designed for Igor Pro

opticalconstants.ipf goes anywhere in user procedures (alias / shortcut from your repository location works fine)

within "user procedures" create a directory called "Optical Constants" and use this location for your repository or copy the txt file database here.  If no txt file exists, when you first save optical constants, it wil create this file.
